# Outdated, already built into Epoch 1.0.7

# [EPOCH 1.0.6.2] Zupa Single Currency
Zupas Single Currency script updated for Epoch 1.0.6+ by salival.

* Discussion URL: https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/43331-zsc-for-epoch-106-and-overwatch-025/
* original install url: https://github.com/EpochSC/SingleCurrencyStorage
* original discussion url: https://epochmod.com/forum/topic/28493-alpha-release-single-currency-30-storage-default-hive-no-global-banking/
	
* Tested as working on a blank Epoch 1.0.6+ and OverWatch 0.25 server.
* Designed to minimize duping/glitching of bank related saving with nearby players (checkWallet etc).
* Lots of code snippets taken from the original Zupa release thread to stop multiple people checking wallet/depositing into the same safe etc.
* Supports multiple configuration types, Safes/lockboxes only, vehicles only, safes/lockboxes AND vehicles.
* Supports any map, currently only has server_traders files for Chernarus (default),Â napf and tavi.

# Thanks to:
* Zupa for his awesome script being a really good base to start from.
* JasonTM for getting a working copy of the global banking (https://github.com/worldwidesorrow)
* kingpapawawa for helping with testing and supplying the bank icon

# Install:

* This install basically assumes you have NO custom variables.sqf or compiles.sqf or fn_selfActions.sqf, I would recommend diffmerging where possible. 
* This has all the config traders set up for epoch 1.0.6+ items and OverWatch guns/items. You will need to install the specific version you want to use, See install notes further down.

# Mission folder install:

1. In mission\init.sqf find: 
	```sqf
	call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "\z\addons\dayz_code\init\variables.sqf";
	```
	
	and add directly below:

	```sqf

	```
	
	and replace with:

	```sqf
	call compile preprocessFileLineNumbers "scripts\traders\server_traders.sqf";
	```

# dayz_server folder install:

1. Replace or merge the contents of <code>server_handleSafeGear.sqf</code> provided with your original copy.

# Changing to global banking:

1. In mission\dayz_code\init\variables.sqf find:
	```sqf
	Z_globalBanking = false; // Enable global banking? Disabled by default.
	```
	and change to true so it looks like this:
	```sqf
	Z_globalBanking = true; // Enable global banking? Disabled by default.
	```

2. Battleye filters for global banking:

	In your config\<yourServerName>\Battleye\scripts.txt around line 12: <code>5 createDialog</code> or <code>5 "createDialog"</code> add this to the end of it:
	```sqf
	!"createDialog \"atmDialog\";"
	```

	So it will then look like this for example:

	```sqf
	5 "createDialog" <CUT> !"createDialog \"BankDialog\";" !"createDialog \"GivePlayerDialog\";" !"createDialog \"atmDialog\";"
	```

3. In infiSTARS AHConfig.sqf, If you have the following line set to true:
	```sqf
	/*  Check Actions ?       */ _CSA = false;	/* true or false */	/* this checks mousewheel actions */
	```
	
	Then you will need to find this line in AHConfig.sqf:
	```sqf
	"r_player_actions2","s_bank_dialog","s_bank_dialog2","s_build_Hedgehog_DZ","s_build_Sandbag1_DZ","s_build_Wire_cat1","s_building_snapping",
	```
	
	And replace it with this line:
	```sqf
	"r_player_actions2","s_bank_dialog","s_bank_dialog1","s_bank_dialog2","s_build_Hedgehog_DZ","s_build_Sandbag1_DZ","s_build_Wire_cat1","s_building_snapping",
	```

# Battleye filter install.

1. In your config\<yourServerName>\Battleye\scripts.txt around line 12: <code>5 createDialog</code> add this to the end of it:

	```sqf
	!="createDialog \"BankDialog\";" !="createDialog \"GivePlayerDialog\";"
	```

	So it will then look like this for example:

	```sqf
	5 createDialog <CUT> !="createDialog \"BankDialog\";" !="createDialog \"GivePlayerDialog\";"
	```

2. In your config\<yourServerName>\Battleye\scripts.txt around line 51: <code>5 toString</code> add this to the end of it:

	```sqf
	!"_input = parseNumber (toString (_input));"
	```
	
	So it will then look like this for example:

	```sqf
	5 toString <CUT> !"_input = parseNumber (toString (_input));"
	```

# Installing NPC based banks (optional)

1. Copy the following directory to your <code>Arma2 OA\\@dayz_epoch_server\addons\dayz_server</code> folder:
	```sqf
	dayz_server\bankTraders
	```

2. In mission\init.sqf find this line:
	```sqf
	execVM "\z\addons\dayz_server\traders\chernarus11.sqf"; //Add trader agents
	```
	
	add this line directly below:
	```sqf
	if (Z_singleCurrency && {Z_globalBanking && Z_globalBankingTraders}) then {execVM "\z\addons\dayz_server\bankTraders\init.sqf";}; // Add global banking agents
	```

3. In <code>dayz_code\init\variables.sqf</code> change the following line to <code>true</code>
	```sqf
	Z_globalBankingTraders = false; // Enable global banking traders at trader cities? Disabled by default.
	```

# Changing from default epoch CfgTraders to OverWatch CfgTraders:

1. In <code>dayz_code\configs</code> move or delete the folder <code>Category</code> and the file <code>cfgServerTrader.hpp</code> 

2. Rename <code>Category - Overwatch</code> to <code>Category</code> 

3. Rename <code>cfgServerTrader - Overwatch.hpp</code> to <code>cfgServerTrader.hpp</code>

4. In <code>scripts\traders</code> move or delete the file <code>server_traders.sqf</code>

5. Rename <code>server_traders - overwatch.sqf</code> to <code>server_traders.sqf</code>

# Changing from default Chernarus server_traders to any other map:

1. In <code>scripts\traders</code> move or delete the file <code>server_traders.sqf</code>

2. Rename <code>server_traders - whatever-map-name.sqf</code> to <code>server_traders.sqf</code>

# Changing so players don't lose coins on death (PVE weenies)

1. In mission\dayz_code\init\variables.sqf find this line or similar relating to ZSC:
	```sqf
	ZSC_MaxMoneyInStorageMultiplier = 50000; // Multiplier for how much money a bank object can hold, example: 200 magazine slots in the object (or the default value above ^^) multiplied by the 50,000 multiplier is 10 million coin storage. (200*50000=10m coins)
	```

	Add this line after it:
	```sqf
	Z_moneyVariable = "GlobalMoney"; // Uncomment this this to make it so players don't lose coins on death. Will need to disable checkWallet as you can dupe if you have this and check wallet running.
	```
	You will also need to disable/remove check wallet as then players can get unlimited coins by constantly checking their body.

# Adding other classnames to the list of DZE_MoneyStorageClasses:

1. In <code>dayz_code\init\variables.sqf</code> find: 
	```sqf
	DZE_MoneyStorageClasses = DZE_LockableStorage;
	```

	and replace with (using Plastic_Pole_EP1_DZ as an example):

	```sqf
	DZE_MoneyStorageClasses = DZE_LockableStorage + ["Plastic_Pole_EP1_DZ"];
	```

# Using vehicles to store coins ONLY:

1. In <code>scripts\zsc\bankDialog.sqf</code> find:
	```sqf
	if !(_typeOf in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses) exitWith {
	```

	and replace with:

	```sqf
	if !(ZSC_CurrentStorage isKindOf "AllVehicles") exitWith {
	```

2. In <code>dayz_code\compile\fn_selfActions.sqf</code> find: 
	```sqf
	if (_typeOfCursorTarget in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses && {!_isLocked} && {!(_typeOfCursorTarget in DZE_LockedStorage)}) then {
	```

	and replace with:

	```sqf
	if (_isVehicle && {!_isMan} && {!_isLocked} && {_isAlive}) then {
	```

3. dayz_server folder install:

	Replace or merge the contents of <code>dayz_server\system\server_monitor.sqf</code> provided with your original copy.

# Using vehicles AND DZE_MoneyStorageClasses to store coins:

1. In <code>scripts\zsc\bankDialog.sqf</code> find: 
	```sqf
	if !(_typeOf in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses) exitWith {
	```
	
	and replace with:

	```sqf
	if ((!(_typeOf in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses) && !(cursortarget isKindOf "AllVehicles"))) exitWith {
	```
	
2. In <code>dayz_code\compile\fn_selfActions.sqf</code> find: 
	```sqf
	if (_typeOfCursorTarget in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses && {!_isLocked} && {!(_typeOfCursorTarget in DZE_LockedStorage)}) then {
	```
	
	and replace with:

	```sqf
	if ((_typeOfCursorTarget in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses || _isVehicle) && {!_isMan} && {!_isLocked} && {_isAlive} && {!(_typeOfCursorTarget in DZE_LockedStorage)}) then {
	```
	
3. dayz_server folder install:

	Replace or merge the contents of <code>dayz_server\system\server_monitor.sqf</code> provided with your original copy.
	
	In <code>dayz_server\system\server_monitor.sqf</code> find:
	```sqf
	if (Z_SingleCurrency && {_type in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses}) then {
	```

	and replace with:

	```sqf
	if (Z_SingleCurrency && {(_type in DZE_MoneyStorageClasses) || (_object isKindOf "AllVehicles")}) then {
	```
	
# Giving NEW players coins on their first login:

1. In <code>dayz_server\compile\server_playerLogin.sqf</code> find:
	```sqf
	PVCDZ_plr_Login = [_charID,_inventory,_backpack,_survival,_isNew,dayz_versionNo,_model,_isHiveOk,_newPlayer,_isInfected,_group,_CharacterCoins,_playerCoins,_BankCoins];
	```
	
	If you want to give the player (so coins are on the body) 5k coins, add this line before it:
	
	```sqf
	if (_newPlayer) then {_characterCoins = 5000;};
	```
	
	If you want to give the player 5k coins into their bank, add this line instead:
	```sqf
	if (_newPlayer) then {_bankCoins = 5000;};
	```
